            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Onigiri is made with Japanese short grain rice that is rinsed, soaked and steamed and then formed into triangular, 
                round or cylindrical shapes. It often contains some kind of filling,
                and is usually wrapped with nori--roasted seaweed.</p>

           <h3>Steps</h3>
           <ol>
               <li>Heat up a frying pan on medium and add 1 tsp unsalted butter. </li>
               <br>
               <li>Once the butter is melted, add the salmon filled to the pan and fry until it's cooked through and flakey.</li>
               <br>
               <li>Using a wooden spatula, break up the salmon into smaller flakes.</li>
               <br>
               <li>Add 1 tbsp soy sauce to the pan, mix with the salmon flakes and cook until liquid is gone.</li>
               <br>
               <li>Turn off the heat and transfer the cooked salmon flakes to a large heatproof bowl.</li>
               <br>
               <li>Add the cooked rice, Â½ tbsp white sesame seeds and 1 tbsp of chopped spring onion to the bowl.</li>
               <br>
               <li>Mix well until the ingredients are evenly distributed through the rice.</li>
               <br>
               <li>Take approx 100-130g of the rice and shape it into a rounded triangle using your preferred method. (Make sure to sprinkle salt on your hands/plastic wrap/mold first. If using bare hands, submerge them in ice cold water and rub salt over them before shaping.)</li>
               <br>
               <li>Don't handle the rice for too long, quicker is better. Once you're happy with the shape, wrap it with nori.</li>
               <br>
               <li>Repeat steps 8-9 until you have 5-6 rice balls</li>
               <br>
               <li>Eat straight away or put in your lunch box with an ice pack. Best eaten the same day. </li>
               <br>
               <li>Enjoy!</li>
